# Important information to run the notebook

I created this Wolfram notebook to play around and understand the path delay and doppler shift of a radio signal in a dispersive medium. You can find the main sources of my work in the notebook itself.

## Important notes for the notebook:

1. The notebook is self-consistent and can be deployed anywhere.
2. The csv data are not needed in itself, but they are used if "DoneAlready" is True, which is the faster way. Otherwise, the user can modify the parameter and re-run the computation of 
Path delays and Doppler shifts to verify consistency, but this operation can take several minutes.
3. The two plots provided should be equal to the first two that are created in the notebook.
4. The pdf version doesn't truly support the interactive plot at the end of the notebook.
